# DWG-TitleBlock-Signature
This is an application that allows the user fill in the title block fields with text or signature in an AutoCAD drawing in the browser. The signatures will be merged to the drawing (as a kind of entity ‘Solid’). The application also provides the user to download the updated drawing.
